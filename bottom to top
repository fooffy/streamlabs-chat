So go to your chatbox and enable custom code, then go to the CSS tab.

In there, find
(not #log>div)
#log {
    things
    like
    position
    and 
    so 
    on
}

In there youll find this property:

position: absolute;

Now replace that with this:

position: column-reverse;
display: flex;
flex-direction: column-reverse;

It dosen't matter if you have:

display: table;
and 
display: flex;

in there, it is working anyway.
You only need to have a look that "position: absolute;" is not in the code anymore.

Now, you're finished!
